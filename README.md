My experiments with OpenGL using Scala and LWJGL.

&nbsp;

##### Building and running

Currently the only way of building and running the project that I know of is importing it
to Eclipse and setting LWJGL up as a libray. It should be possible to do it via the command
line or sbt but I haven't figured out the correct command line arguments yet.

In order to run the latest experiment you need OpenGL 4.3 support or at least the `ARB_multi_draw_indirect` extension.
